 * the grid costs one query however many agents there are:
 *   1. a run in flight (`running` / `awaiting_approval`) — the agent is working this second;
 *   2. otherwise its last finished run, which says how the last piece of work ended;
 *   3. otherwise the last thing it did in the activity log (agents act through the same
 *      handlers people do, so they leave the same trail);
 *   4. otherwise the next duty due, which is what it is *about* to do.
 * When all four are empty the card says so in words rather than showing a confident zero —
 * the runner, prompt ledger and agent runs arrive with AI ops (phase 5), so an agent hired
 * today has genuinely done nothing yet, and the card must not imply it is broken.
 *
 * Reads go through the mcp_* views, so a member sees only the agents they are allowed to see;
