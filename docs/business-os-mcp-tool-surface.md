# Business OS MCP Tool Surface

2026-09-17 · Edward Honour · **Draft for M1 review (build plan 1.5)**. Decisions 1, 2, 4 and 6 approved 2026-09-17.

> Contract: every question in `docs/business-os-questions.md` maps to a tool below (coverage index at the end). A question with no tool is unfinished design.
> Reads: the `mcp_*` views in `db/050_mcp_views_business.sql` and `db/052_mcp_audit_views.sql` (schema: `docs/business-os-schema.md`).
> Replaces nothing yet: the cert-study tools in `docs/mcp-tool-surface.md` keep running until those modules are retired.

## Summary

- **135 business tools:** 118 on the records server and 17 on the activity server. They cover all 292 questions; 291 go through these two servers and DC9 goes through the desk tools (Phase 6).
- **The tools add no access of their own.** They read only `mcp_*` views, so visibility is decided in SQL for every caller, human or agent. A tool never reveals whether a hidden record exists.
- **Most tools serve several questions** through filters, which keeps the list short enough for agents to choose well. Each caller's tool list is also filtered to what they can use (decision 2).

## Conventions (every tool)

- **Read-only.** Every tool has `readOnlyHint: true`, and the servers connect as `app_records_ro` / `app_activity_ro`. Writes happen only through the app and the actions server.
- **Inputs:** Pydantic v2 models with `extra="forbid"` and a constraint on every field, as in the existing servers.
    - **Ids** are integers. Tools that take a human description instead (a name, an invoice number) resolve it or say how to.
    - **Periods:** `period` accepts `today`, `this_week`, `last_week`, `this_month`, `last_month`, `this_quarter`, `last_quarter`, `ytd`, `last_12_months`, or explicit `from` / `to` ISO dates. Days and months use the business timezone and fiscal year start.
    - **Paging:** `limit` defaults to 25 (max 100), plus `offset`. Every list reply reports `truncated`.
- **Money** is always grouped by currency and never summed across currencies. Every amount carries its currency code.
- **Empty results** say "nothing found you can see" and never "not allowed", following the questions doc's rule for hidden records.
- **Errors are actionable:** "no organization matched 'acme'; try `find_contacts` with a shorter fragment".
- **Every call is logged** to `activity_log` as `mcp.tool_call`, with `source='mcp'`, the tool name, the arguments, the duration, and `entity_type='mcp_access_token'` pointing at the calling token (feeds A9, X7).
- **Gate** (last column below): which callers see the tool in their tool list.
    - A **module** gate means a super-admin, a dept-admin inside the departments they administer, or any member holding that module grant.
    - **admin** means a super-admin, or a dept-admin for rows in a department they administer (and for people they administer); **super** means super-admin only; **all** means anyone signed in; **insider** excludes external members.
    - Agents additionally need a live `agent_tool_grants` row for the tool.
    - The view still decides the rows, so a gate only trims the list.

## Records server — `certstudy_records_mcp` (role `app_records_ro`)

### Shared memory & skills *(approved 2026-09-19 — a third read server, `certstudy_memory_mcp`, port 8814; built in H4/H5)*

The Memory server holds the tenant's MaluDB token and enforces scope: a caller recalls its own memory, its departments' and the organisation's — never another member's. Writes are manifest actions, not tools.

## Desk tools (Phase 6, local only)

DC9 ("what's in the spreadsheet or folder on my desk") is answered by the desktop companion's local tool layer, never by the server. Planned names, specified in the Phase 6 build spec: `desk_list_folder`, `desk_read_file`, `desk_summarize_spreadsheet`, `desk_search_files`. Their scope is limited to opted-in folders, and nothing they read reaches the server without an explicit import.

## Questions that take both servers

One tool can't join the two memories, because each server runs as its own role. These questions are answered in two calls, and the tool descriptions say which tool comes next.

| Question | First call | Then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PL2 prompt behind an action | `record_history` (activity) → `request_id` | `prompt_for_request` (records) |
| H4 agent performance | `agent_performance` (records) | `activity_summary` (activity) |
| DB7 what agents did today | `agent_timeline` (activity) | `agent_performance` + `ai_spend` (records) |
| A10 who invited X and first login | `team_invitations` (records) | `login_history` (activity) |
| S22 who issued a refund, and was it approved | `refunds_and_disputes` (records) | `record_history` (activity) |
| E12 money-out actions by agents | `approval_history` (records) | `ai_changes` (activity) |
| SM13 published without approval | `unapproved_publishing` (records) | `unapproved_actions` (activity) |

## Decisions

1. **Extend the two existing servers** *(approved 2026-09-17)*. The business tools join `certstudy_records_mcp` and `certstudy_activity_mcp`, so endpoints, tokens and the Apache proxy stay as they are. The cert-study tools stay until those modules are retired. `record_history` keeps its name but moves to `mcp_activity_entity_history`, a superset of today's organizer-only view.
2. **Each caller's tool list is filtered** *(approved 2026-09-17)*. `list_tools` shows a tool only when the caller passes its gate (module grant, role, and for agents an `agent_tool_grants` row). A staff member without the sales module never sees the ten sales tools, and an agent sees only the tools it was hired with. This needs a small change to `server_common.py`: gate metadata per tool, checked in `list_tools` and again on call.
3. **Consolidated tools with filters.** 135 tools answer 292 questions. Each tool's description names its questions, so the questions doc doubles as the eval set for the tools.
4. *(Approved 2026-09-17.)* **Aggregates are computed in tool SQL over the views,** not in extra database views. The views are the security boundary, and aggregating over them can't widen access. The only new view is `mcp_activity_unapproved_actions` (052), because that audit must join activity to policies within one role.
5. **Two-call answers across the memories,** as listed above. No tool reads both databases.
6. **MaluDB semantic recall is super-admin only for now** *(approved 2026-09-17; narrowed with the three-role model)*. MaluDB episodes carry no per-member visibility, so `activity_recall` could surface activity a user — or a dept-admin outside their departments — may not see. Every other activity tool reads the visibility-scoped Postgres views. Widening recall needs per-member scoping in the ingestion bridge (a later change).
7. **Logging conventions the audits depend on.** Money actions write `amount` and `currency` into `after`. Every tool call is logged as `mcp.tool_call` with its token. Both go into every build spec's checklist.
8. **Office-manager routing is a normal tool.** `route_request` is gated to office-manager agents and managers. It only recommends; assignment is an action through the actions server.
