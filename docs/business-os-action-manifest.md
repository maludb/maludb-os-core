# Business OS Action Manifest

2026-09-17 · Edward Honour · **Draft for M1 review (build plan 1.6)**

> The registry the command bar, the actions MCP server and AI agents resolve against. A screen or action missing here can't be reached by voice or by an agent: unfinished design, like a question with no tool.
> Pairs with: `docs/business-os-schema.md` (tables), `docs/business-os-mcp-tool-surface.md` (read tools). Approval defaults: `db/053_seed_approval_policies.sql`.
> The cert-study manifest (`docs/action-manifest.md`) is history: those tables went with the kernel cut, 2026-09-22.

## Summary

- **The kernel's screens and actions** (2026-09-22: the business modules' sections — CRM, sales, expenses, projects, scheduling, tickets, documents, time, content, assets, books, inbox, people, inventory, e-signature, portal, reports, company profile — and the command bar's own tools left this manifest with the kernel cut, db/133; each returns as an application's own manifest). Every table a person or agent changes has its create, update and lifecycle actions, and every list, detail and form page has a screen id.
- **The same endpoints serve three callers:** a person clicking, the command bar acting for a person, and an AI agent acting under its own staff identity. Validation, authorization, activity logging and approval checks run once, in PHP.
- **Agent approvals are designed in.** 18 proposed default policies cover money out, deletions and external sends. A matching action by an agent returns `pending_approval` instead of executing.

## Conventions

### Screens

- **Ids** are kebab-case `{entity}-list`, `{entity}-add`, `{entity}-view`, `{entity}-edit`, plus named screens (`receivables`, `content-calendar`).
- **Canonical URLs:** `/{module}/`, `/{module}/new`, `/{module}/{id}`, `/{module}/{id}/edit`. Needs mod_rewrite (decision 2).
- **Prefill params** in the registry become query-string values the GET controller reads, as in the fork. `{id}` params accept the record id; `navigate` resolves names to ids with the read tools first.
- **Every screen partial stamps** `data-screen`, `data-entity` and `data-record-id` on `#page-content`, so "that", "this invoice" and "add a task here" resolve against the page the user is on.

### Actions

- **Name** `{entity}_{verb}`, snake_case. The **log event** is `{entity}.{verb}`, written by the endpoint with `log_activity()`. Approval policies match these log events.
    - `.delete` means a record is destroyed; `.remove` means something is detached (a line, a member, a dependency). Only `.delete` falls under the "any deletion" policy.
    - Money actions write `amount` and `currency` into the log row's `after`, so thresholds and the audit views work.
- **Endpoints** are POST to `/{module}/{file}.php` with `require_post()`, `verify_csrf()` (or the signed action token), authorization and `log_activity()`. Each section below gives its base path; the table shows the file.
- **Params:** **bold** means required. **A param's name is the field the endpoint reads**, so the actions server can be generated from this table without a translation layer; a `[]` suffix marks a repeated field. A param named for a record (`organization_id`, `member`, `deal`) accepts an id *or* a name and is resolved server-side. A record param takes a name, number or id ("the Acme invoice", "INV-00042", `42`). An ambiguous match fails with the candidates, so the assistant asks one short question.
- **Who** is enforced in the endpoint, with the same gates as the tool surface: `mod:x` means a super-admin, a dept-admin acting inside a department they administer, or a holder of module grant x; `admin` means a super-admin or a dept-admin within their departments; `super` means super-admin only; `all` means any signed-in member; `own` means the record's owner, assignee or requester.
- **Undo** is the inverse applied by `undo_last`. An em dash (—) means it can't be undone (an email went out); the reply says so instead of offering Undo.
- **Confirm (✔)** means the command bar asks before executing: destructive actions, and external sends (decision 4). Everything else executes immediately with an Undo.
- **Agent approval** names the category of the default policy that pauses the action when an agent performs it: `money`, `delete` or `send`. Humans are never paused by the defaults.
- **Refresh:** a data action returns `HX-Trigger: {entity}Changed` (camelCase entity), so listening screen regions reload themselves.
- **The per-department admin flag is set by `department_add_member`** (param `is_admin`), on the way in and afterwards: it is what makes a dept-admin an administrator of *that* department and an ordinary user everywhere else, so it belongs to the membership, not to the member.

### Result contract (actions server)

```json
{"status": "success", "did": "Logged 45 min on Acme website redesign", "undo_id": "act_8231", "refresh": "timeEntryChanged"}
{"status": "pending_approval", "did": "Refund of $250.00 to Acme waits for Edward's approval", "approval_request_id": 17}
{"status": "error", "message": "Found 2 invoices for Acme: INV-00041 ($1,200), INV-00042 ($500). Which one?"}
```

For `pending_approval`, the endpoint writes an `approval_requests` row with the action key, parameters and amount, notifies the approver, and executes nothing. On approval, the app replays the stored parameters through the same endpoint and records `executed_activity_id`. Undo of a pending action cancels the request.

> **Generated, not transcribed.** `bin/build_action_registry.php` parses this file into `mcp/action_registry.json`, and the actions server builds `find_screen`, `navigate` and one tool per action from it at startup. A slice's rows are finalised to the endpoint's real field names when the slice is built; until then an action is registered (and findable) but not exposed as a tool, because a tool that would 404 is worse than no tool.

**Deleting a department** (2026-09-23) is the super-admin's remedy for one nothing works in. It is refused, by name, while anything is still attached — people or agents who are live members, a named manager, departments that report to it, applications it owns, open invitations into it — or while history names it: a ledger statement line or an eval set (both foreign keys are `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and a closed statement never changes). The four standing departments are never deleted. What goes with the row is the department's own configuration and its dated past — past memberships, approval policies, skill assignments, application access grants — and `department.delete` counts them into the log with what the department was, since `activity_log` holds no foreign key to `departments`. The directory's change feed reports the deletion from that log entry (`deleted_departments`), so an application's mirror drops its row. On `department-view` and `department-edit` the button is disabled with the blockers in its title until the department is empty.

2FA enrollment and disabling stay as in the fork (`totp_enable`, `totp_disable`) and remain screen-first.

| `location_delete` | `delete.php` | **location** (only one nothing points at) | — | ✔ | | `location.delete` | super |

Desk enrollment happens in the desktop app's sign-in flow (screen only, Phase 6). A building or office is never retired while it still has active children, applications or resident members; the endpoint refuses and names them.

Retire and delete are different remedies. **Retire** ends a location's working life and keeps it: the row, its specs and everything that happened there stay readable. **Delete** is for a location that should never have existed, and the super-admin alone may do it — refused, by name, the moment anything still points at it (locations inside it, residents, departments homed there, applications, agents, duties, runs, prompt-ledger entries, tasks, documents, employment profiles, stock locations). The activity trail survives either way: `activity_log` holds no foreign key to `locations`, and `location.delete` records what the location was.

| `application_roles_set` | `roles-set.php` | **application**, **roles** (by hand - only for an application that does not publish its roles; a JSON list of objects with key/name/capability/is_admin — exactly one is_admin; an empty list removes them all) | set the prior list | | never delegable to agents | `application.roles_set` | super |

An application's credential is a reference to a tenant secret: the action stores the reference, and no screen, view, tool or log row ever carries the value. An agent reaching an application needs a live `application_access` row as well as its tool grants — granting an agent access to an application is itself a logged action.

## Approvals

Screens:

| Screen id | URL | When the user wants… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `approvals` | `/approvals/` | what waits for their approval, or requests they made (params: `role`, `status`) |
| `approval-view` | `/approvals/{id}` | one request: the action, parameters, amount, requester, the agent run behind it |
| `approval-policies-settings` | `/settings/approval-policies` | which actions need approval, for whom, above what amount |
| `approval-policy-add` | `/settings/approval-policies/new` | to add a policy |
| `approval-policy-edit` | `/settings/approval-policies/{id}/edit` | to edit a policy |

Actions (base `/approvals/`):

| Action | File | Params | Undo | Confirm | Agent approval | Log | Who |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `approval_reject` | `reject.php` | **approval_request**, **reason** | — | | | `approval_request.reject` | the approver |

| `approval_policy_save` | `/settings/approval-policies/save.php` | **name**, **category**, **action_pattern**, applies_to, agent, department, amount_threshold, currency, approver, expires_after_hours, policy | restore prior / delete new | ✔ | | `approval_policy.save` | super |
| `approval_policy_set_active` | `/settings/approval-policies/active.php` | **policy**, **active** | toggle back | ✔ | | `approval_policy.set_active` | super |
| `approval_policy_delete` | `/settings/approval-policies/delete.php` | **policy** | — | ✔ | delete | `approval_policy.delete` | super |

Approving is never available to an agent: the endpoint refuses when the acting member is an agent, whatever its grants.

## AI: prompt log, models & evals

Screens:

| Screen id | URL | When the user wants… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt-log` | `/ai/prompt-log` | model calls (params: `agent`, `status`, `request_id`, `run`, `period`) |

Agents can't reach eval authoring or grading. The endpoints refuse agent callers, matching the read-side rule that agents never see eval cases.

## Memory & skills *(approved 2026-09-19 — stage H1 of `docs/hermes-integration-plan.md`; built in H4 and H5)*

Shared memory and shared skills live in MaluDB. Reads go through the Memory MCP server; **writes are these actions**, through PHP like every other change, so the gate, `log_activity()` and `check_approval()` all apply. An agent never holds a MaluDB token.

Actions (base `/`):

| Action | File | Params | Undo | Confirm | Agent approval | Log | Who |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory_remember` | `memory/remember.php` | **text**, **subject** (what it is about: one customer or vendor or process), scope (self/department/org; default self), department | supersede the note | | department and org scope | `memory.remember` | any insider; agents: own scope free, wider scope by approval |
| `core_memory_set` | `memory/core-set.php` | **key**, **value**, member (default: caller) | restore prior (superseded, never overwritten) | | | `memory.core_set` | the member itself, its manager, mod:hr |
| `skill_propose` | `skills/propose.php` | **agent_run**, **skill_name**, **bundle** | withdraw | | always — the manager reads the diff | `skill.propose` | the runner, for the run's agent |
| `skill_proposal_decide` | `skills/decide.php` | **skill_proposal**, **decision**, note | — | ✔ | never delegable to agents | `skill.approve` / `skill.reject` | the agent's manager, mod:hr |
| `skill_assign` | `skills/assign.php` | **skill_name**, **scope_kind** (org/department/role/agent/application), department, role_key, agent, application, pinned_bundle_hash | revoke | | never delegable to agents | `skill.assign` | mod:hr; dept-admin within their departments; mod:applications for an application |
| `skill_unassign` | `skills/unassign.php` | **skill_assignment** | assign again | ✔ | never delegable to agents | `skill.unassign` | mod:hr; dept-admin within their departments; mod:applications for an application |
| `skill_save` | `ai/skills/save.php` | **name**, **description**, **body** (the instructions: SKILL.md after its frontmatter), files[] (reference files - each a path and its text) | enable the previous version | | never delegable to agents | `skill.save` | super |
| `skill_set_enabled` | `ai/skills/enabled.php` | **name**, **skill** (the version's id), **enabled** (1 or 0) | set it back | | never delegable to agents | `skill.set_enabled` | super |

The library itself — every skill, its versions, its text and files — is AI Ops → **Skills** (`/ai/skills`, screens `skills-library`, `skills-library-view`, `skills-library-form`; 2026-09-27). A save never edits a version: a changed bundle becomes a new version, the old ones kept. Agents READ the library through two Records MCP tools, when granted: `skill_library` (the enabled skills, their descriptions and files) and `skill_read` (a skill's full SKILL.md or one reference file, newest enabled version) — what a Claude-harness agent's persona cuts off after 6,000 characters, and the reference files it has no other way to open.

## Written by the system, not by actions

These tables change only through webhooks, scheduled jobs or the agent runtime, never through a person, the command bar or an agent's action call. Each writer still logs to `activity_log` (sources `webhook`, `cron`, `agent`).

| Writer | Tables |
| --- | --- |
| Payment provider webhooks | `provider_events`, `provider_payments`, `payouts`, `disputes`, online `payments` and their allocations, `payment_links` status |
| MaluMail webhooks + mail sender | `email_messages`, `email_suppressions` (bounce/complaint), `digest_sends`, `notifications.email_sent_at` |
| Agent runtime (harness) | `agent_runs`, `prompt_ledger`, `prompt_payloads` |
| Eval runner | `eval_runs` progress, `eval_results` (non-human graders), `trace_grades`, `eval_alerts` raised by a schedule, `eval_schedules.next_run_at` |
| Invoice send / void / credit in full (inside those actions) | `stock_movements` of kind `sale` and `return`, `stock_levels` — logged as `stock_movement.sale` / `stock_movement.return` on the invoice |
| Approval endpoints (inside other actions) | `approval_requests` creation, `hr_events` |
| Scheduled jobs | recurring expense instances, duty runs (`agent_duties.next_run_at`), SLA due stamps, payload archival, backups, export expiry, desk presence, `desk_imports` expiry, location presence and `last_seen_at`, `applications.health_status` from scheduled checks, draft `ai_usage_postings` roll-ups awaiting posting |
| Connectors (Phase 4) | `content_metrics` pulls, `channels` connection status, `content_variants` publish results |
| Mail sync | `mail_threads`, `mail_messages`, `mail_attachments` for inbound mail; `mailboxes.last_sync_at` and sync errors; rule effects — logged as `mail_message.receive` (source `cron`), and `ticket.create` when a rule or the mailbox opens a ticket; an attachment download logs `mail_attachment.download` |
| Bank feeds and imports | `bank_transactions` rows and their import batch; `bank_accounts.last_synced_at` |
| Posting engine | `journal_entries` and `journal_lines` written from invoices, payments, expenses, AI usage, pay runs and stock movements; `ai_usage_postings.journal_entry_id` |
| Stock engine | `stock_levels` recalculated from `stock_movements`; reorder-point notifications |
| Signing page (`/sign/{token}` — no login; the private link is the authority) | `signature_signers` status, typed name, consent, drawn signature, address and browser; `signature_events`; the request's status; on completion the executed copy as a new `documents` row — logged as `signature_signer.view` / `.sign` / `.decline`, `signature_request.complete` and `document.create` with no actor |
| Signature provider webhooks | `signature_requests` status, `signature_signers` status and timestamps, `signature_events`, the executed document |
| Public form endpoint | `form_submissions` and the contact, ticket or deal a submission creates (an appointment is never booked automatically); `forms.submission_count` — logged as `form_submission.create` (source `portal`) plus the created record's own event; a filled honeypot is stored as `spam` and creates nothing |
| Report scheduler | `report_runs` from schedules, `report_schedules.next_run_at` — logged as `report_schedule.deliver` (source `cron`); a LINK is mailed and no export document is made |

## Voice coverage (spot checks)

| Utterance | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| "take me to Acme" | `find_screen` → `navigate(organization-view, {id})` |
| "add a deal for Acme, website redesign, twelve thousand, closing end of October" | `deal_create` |
| "move the Acme deal to proposal" | `deal_move_stage` |
| "I just talked to Maria at Beta about the renewal, she wants a quote by Friday" | `interaction_log` + `task_create` |
| "invoice Acme for the redesign hours this month and send it" | `invoice_create` → `invoice_add_unbilled` → `invoice_send` (confirm) |
| "they paid twelve hundred by check today" (on an invoice) | `payment_record` (invoice from screen context) |
| "log a forty dollar lunch with the Acme team, billable" | `expense_create` |
| "remind Acme about invoice forty two" | `invoice_send_reminder` (confirm) |
| "assign the homepage task to Sam, due Thursday" | `task_assign` + `task_reschedule` |
| "book a two hour site visit at Beta next Tuesday at ten with Olive" | `appointment_create` |
| "reply to this ticket saying the fix ships Monday" | `ticket_reply` (confirm) |
| "log forty five minutes on the Acme project" / "start a timer on Beta support" | `time_log` / `timer_start` |
| "schedule the launch post for LinkedIn Monday at nine" | `content_schedule` |
| "give the accountant read access to sales" | `module_grant_set` |
| "change the support agent's budget to two hundred a month" | `agent_update_config` (new version; activation after evals) |
| "approve it" (on an approval) | `approval_approve` (confirm) |
| "ask Ed's desk to summarize the Q3 spreadsheet" | `location_task_create` |
| "turn this prompt into an eval case for the bookkeeper" (on a prompt-log entry) | `eval_case_promote_trace` |
| "undo that" | `undo_last` |

## Decisions for approval

1. **`find_screen` + `navigate` instead of one routing list.** 148 screens is far past the ~40 where a single `navigate` description classifies reliably, so the assistant searches first when the id isn't obvious. The actions server builds both from this manifest at startup.
2. **Enable mod_rewrite in the shell conversion (1.8)** so canonical URLs (`/invoices/42/edit`) are served directly. The fork's `form.php?id=` fallback is retired for new modules.
3. **One naming rule ties manifest, logs and approvals together.** Action `entity_verb` logs `entity.verb`, and approval policies match those events. `.delete` destroys a record and `.remove` detaches something.
4. **External sends confirm first, by voice too.** Emailing an invoice, replying to a customer or publishing a post can't be undone, so they join destructive actions in asking first. Creates and updates still execute immediately with Undo, as the locked policy says.
5. **Actions are approval-aware.** Every endpoint checks the active policies for the acting member. A match writes an approval request and returns `pending_approval` without executing; approval replays the stored call through the same endpoint.
6. **Some actions are screen-only:** file uploads, API keys and payment or channel credentials, 2FA, token display, desk enrollment. Secrets and raw files never pass through the assistant or an agent's context.
7. **Agent configuration changes only as versions.** `agent_update_config` writes a draft version and queues a change-control eval run. `agent_activate_version` refuses without a passing gating run, which keeps EV8 at zero. Agents can't approve, author evals or grade.
8. **18 default approval policies, active now** (`db/053`). They pause agents on refunds, credit notes, write-offs, bill payments, expenses over 250 (base currency), recurring expenses, any deletion, voids, and every external send. The thresholds question stays open; editing a policy is one screen.
9. **Cert-study screens and actions stay registered** in their own manifest until retirement. At the shell conversion the business dashboard takes `/`, and the cert-study screens leave the main navigation and the default `find_screen` results.

## Open points

Schema gaps found while writing this manifest are already closed: `db/054_timers_desk_imports.sql` (running timers, staged desk imports) and `db/047` (cancellable data exports).

1. **Agent ticket replies need approval by default.** That makes a support agent draft-only until someone lowers the policy for it. Confirm, or exempt replies on tickets the agent is assigned?
2. **Undo window:** `undo_last` currently has no time limit. Recommendation: 10 minutes or 5 later actions, whichever comes first, so "undo that" never reaches back into yesterday.
