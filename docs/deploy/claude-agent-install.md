# Installing the Claude Agent SDK harness on an office VM

The second harness, beside `hermes-install.md`. Everything is idempotent. Node 24 is already a
prerequisite of the platform (the React front end runs on it), so nothing new is needed but the
pinned CLI.

```bash
# 1. The Claude Code CLI, pinned, root-owned, read-only to the agent user. Bump the version ONLY
#    after mcp/claude_conformance passes on it (and then re-run the evals).
sudo install -d -m 0755 -o root -g root /opt/claude-agent
sudo npm install --prefix /opt/claude-agent @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.278 --no-fund --no-audit
sudo install -d -m 0755 /opt/claude-agent/bin
sudo ln -sfn /opt/claude-agent/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe /opt/claude-agent/bin/claude
sudo chmod -R go-w /opt/claude-agent
/opt/claude-agent/bin/claude --version        # must print the pinned version

# 2. The launcher's binary allow-list now has two entries; reinstall it.
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 docs/deploy/bos-agent-exec /usr/local/sbin/bos-agent-exec

# 3. Conformance, BEFORE any agent is pointed at it. Green is the licence to proceed.
cd /var/www/mcp/claude_conformance && python3 run_conformance.py --claude /opt/claude-agent/bin/claude

# 4. Restart the runner; /health must now list both harnesses.
sudo systemctl restart certstudy-agent-runner
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8815/health       # {"ok":true,"running":[],"harnesses":["claude_agent_sdk","hermes"]}
```

No migration and no new secret: the harness authenticates to the **ledger proxy**, not to
Anthropic. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the agent's environment is the run's own proxy key, and the real
provider key stays in `/etc/business-os/runner.env` where only the runner can read it.

## Why `--bare` is not optional

`--bare` makes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or an `apiKeyHelper` given through `--settings`) the **only**
way the CLI can authenticate: OAuth and the OS keychain are never read. That is CLAUDE.md's
"API keys only — no claude.ai/Pro/Max login in the product" enforced by the binary rather than by
our remembering. Conformance C1 proves it with an OAuth credentials file deliberately planted in
the agent's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: the run refuses and makes no upstream call.

It also skips hooks, plugins, LSP, auto-memory and `CLAUDE.md` auto-discovery — each of which
would otherwise put text into the agent that the platform did not put there.

## The one exception: the owner's Claude subscription (off by default)

`--bare` cannot use a subscription, so a model whose `auth_mode` is `claude_subscription` (the "… · Max plan" rows, db/164–166) is launched
whole and fenced instead — see `mcp/agent_runner/claude_launch.py` and conformance **S0–S5**, which plant hooks, `CLAUDE.md` files, settings,
agents, skills and an extra MCP server in every place the CLI looks and fail if any takes effect. **Read the risk in
`docs/build-specs/claude-subscription-auth.md` first.** It is for the owner's own install only, off unless
`docs/deploy/set-claude-subscription.sh on <token-file>` has been run (the token is from `claude setup-token`; the script proves it with
one tiny call, then writes it to the runner's env file, mode preserved, and restarts the runner — refusing while a run is in flight).
`… off` removes it in one step. The agent still never holds the token: the CLI is given the run's proxy key as its login token and the ledger
proxy swaps the real one in. Hermes is not supported on a subscription (it presents itself as Claude Code), and only Claude Code may use one.
Conformance must stay green (S0 is the control that proves the planted files would bite) before the CLI pin is ever bumped.

## No Anthropic account is involved (API-key models)

The agent process runs as `bos-agent` under `systemd-run` with `IPAddressDeny=any` +
`IPAddressAllow=localhost`. It cannot reach `api.anthropic.com` even if it were given a key: every
model call goes to the ledger proxy on 127.0.0.1, which is what puts it in the prompt ledger before
it leaves the box.

## Upgrading

1. `sudo npm install --prefix /opt/claude-agent @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<new version>`
2. `python3 run_conformance.py` — the suite is the upgrade test. If a check fails, the CLI changed
   something we depend on; read `mcp/claude_conformance/README.md` for what each one is for.
3. Only then run the evals.

`agent_runs.sdk_version` records the CLI version and the pinned npm version on every run, so which
release produced a given piece of work is always answerable.
