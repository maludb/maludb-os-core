# The token comes from `claude setup-token` (run where you have a browser), saved to a file (chmod 600, outside the repo) so it never
# appears in a command line or shell history, and is never printed. It goes only into the runner's own env file, mode preserved, and
# the runner's ledger proxy swaps it in for the run's key — no agent ever holds it. Before anything changes, ONE tiny call proves the
# token works with the official CLI; a bad token changes nothing. The runner is restarted, which orphans any run in flight, so the
# script refuses while a run is going unless --force.
