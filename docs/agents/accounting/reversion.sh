# Re-version the Accounting team for the kernel (2026-09-22): the modules their first versions
# read — Books, Expenses, Sales, Documents, Projects — left with the kernel cut (db/133), which
# also deleted their grants on the removed tools. Everything goes through the real PHP handlers as
# member 1. Safe to re-run: grants upsert; a config-save makes a new version each time.
