# MCP servers by business function

2026-09-20 · Reference, generated from the live tool registries (not from the design drafts).

> **What this is.** The Business OS exposes its data and its actions to AI agents and to people's own AI clients through four MCP servers (plus the assistant that drives them). This page orders every tool by the **business function** it serves — sales, service, finance, HR and so on — so you can answer "what can an agent do for Accounting?" without knowing which server a tool lives on. The per-tool design record (question ids, views read, gates) is `docs/business-os-mcp-tool-surface.md`; the write surface is `docs/business-os-action-manifest.md`.

> **Counted 2026-09-20 from the running code:** **125** records tools, **9** activity tools, **3** memory tools and **335** action tools (**472** in all). Of the action tools, 333 are manifest actions and two are navigation (`find_screen`, `navigate`).

## 1. The servers at a glance

| Server | Systemd unit | Port | Reads / writes | Who reaches it | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Records** (`certstudy_records_mcp`) | `certstudy-records-mcp` | 8811 | Read-only, role `app_records_ro`, `mcp_*` views only | People and agents; public at `/mcp/records` | The business's record memory: every "what is / who is / how many" question about customers, money, work, people and estate. **125 tools.** |
| **Activity** (`certstudy_activity_mcp`) | `certstudy-activity-mcp` | 8812 | Read-only, role `app_activity_ro` | People and agents; public at `/mcp/activity` | Who did what and when: the audit trail behind every record. **9 tools.** |
| **Actions** (`certstudy_actions_mcp`) | `certstudy-actions-mcp` | 8813 | **Writes** — POSTs to the PHP handlers as the caller | The assistant and hired agents only; **not** on the public port | Everything that changes state, plus screen navigation. One tool per built manifest action. **335 tools.** |
| **Memory** (`certstudy_memory_mcp`) | `certstudy-memory-mcp` | 8814 | Read-only over MaluDB; holds the tenant token so no one else does | Agents and people; **not** on the public port | Shared memory (what we know, what was said before, standing facts). Writes are manifest actions, never here. **3 tools.** |
| **Assistant** (`certstudy-assistant`) | `certstudy-assistant` | 8765 | — | The command bar in the web app | Not an MCP server: the LLM router that consumes the Records, Activity and Actions tools on behalf of the person typing. |

Supporting services (not MCP): `certstudy-agent-runner` (runner API 8815 and prompt-ledger proxy 8816) runs hired agents and hands each run a scoped token; `certstudy-activity-ingest.timer` ships `activity_log` to MaluDB every minute.

### How every call is authorised

- **Authentication is a bearer token** on every request: a personal MCP token (`php bin/mint_mcp_token.php`), an action token (the Actions server accepts only these) or an agent run token. No token, or an unknown one, is a `401`.
- **Row visibility is decided in SQL, not in the tool.** Each read tool selects from `mcp_*` views that embed the caller's visibility rules, so a person and an agent asking the same question see only what that caller may see, and a hidden record looks the same as one that does not exist.
- **Agents are also gated per tool.** A person sees every tool on a server; a hired agent lists and may call only the tools it holds a live `agent_tool_grants` row for on that server (`mcp/agent_grants.py`, enforced at the MCP boundary). The four endpoints are registered as `Records MCP`, `Activity MCP`, `Actions MCP` and `Memory MCP`.
- **Writes go through PHP.** Action tools POST to the same handlers the React screens use, so the same `require_post` / CSRF / authorisation / `log_activity` rules apply and an approval policy can answer `pending_approval` instead of acting. Every create returns `record_id`.
- **Gate vocabulary** (used in the action manifest): `super` = super-admin only · `admin` = super-admin, or a dept-admin inside their own departments · `mod:x` = either of those, or a holder of module grant *x* · `own` = the caller's own records.
- **What is recorded:** every write is logged to `activity_log` by its PHP handler; an agent run's tool events land in `agent_run_events` and its model calls in the prompt ledger. Plain read calls are not separately logged by the servers.

| Tool | Server | Call it when | Key params |

## 14. Cross-cutting tools

Tools that are not one function's: they reach across all of them.

| Tool | Server | Call it when | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `records_search` | Records | The long tail — a question no named tool answers. One read-only `SELECT`/`WITH` over the `mcp_*` views. | 5 s timeout, 200-row cap, one statement, scoped to what the caller may see. Its own description still lists only the old study-app views; the business views are reachable too. |
| `activity_search` | Activity | The same, over the activity views. | Same guards. |
| `find_screen` | Actions | Turning "take me to the overdue invoices" into a screen. Searches all 243 registered screens. | Read-only. |
| `navigate` | Actions | Opening a screen once found. | Read-only; returns the URL. |

The Memory server's three tools (`recall`, `core_memory`, `session_search`) are in *AI workforce*, because that is whose memory they are; a person can call them too.

## 15. Legacy: community & certification study

The original members-vip app (exams, study plans, issues, events, resources). Its screens and its four action tools retired with the React cut-over on 2026-09-19, but the **read tools are still registered** and still answer. They serve no Business OS function; treat them as retirement candidates once the study modules are formally dropped.

| Tool | Server | Call it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upcoming_calendar` | Records | Exams and community events on the community calendar. |

| `find_issues` | Records | Full-text search issues (M5: 'has anyone been stuck on this?'). |
| `issue_thread` | Records | An issue plus its replies (and which reply was accepted). |

| `community_activity_trend` | Activity | Organizer-only: weekly active members and action counts. |
| `moderation_audit` | Activity | Organizer-only: who hid, cancelled or edited what in the community, and when. |

## 16. Coverage and known gaps

- **Totals:** 107 business read tools across the eleven functions, 28 legacy read tools, 2 cross-cutting search tools (`records_search`, `activity_search`), and 333 action tools (plus `find_screen` and `navigate`) = 137 read tools and 335 on the Actions server.
- **Unbuilt actions:** 26 manifest actions are registered and findable but have no endpoint yet, so they are deliberately **not** exposed as tools.
- **Stale cross-reference:** `books_audit`'s description points at an activity tool `access_changes` that the Activity server does not register. The trail it means is reachable through `record_history` or `activity_search`.
- **Not on the public port:** `/mcp/actions` and `/mcp/memory` are localhost-only (only `/mcp/records` and `/mcp/activity` are proxied by the allow-list in `docs/deploy/apache-react-cutover.conf`). A person's own AI client can read but not write.

### How to keep this page true

It was produced by importing the four servers and listing their registered tools, plus `mcp/action_registry.json` for the actions. When a slice adds a tool, add it to the matching function here in the same session (the same rule as the requirements copies), and re-run the counts.
