"""Memory MCP server — shared memory on MaluDB, read side (docs/build-specs/agent-memory.md).

MaluDB namespaces are labels, not access control: the tenant token reads all of them. So this
server holds the token and NOBODY ELSE DOES — no agent, no person. Every tool resolves the caller
from its verified bearer token (personal token, action token or agent run token) and derives the
namespaces it may read from Postgres, never from an argument:

    self        agent:<member_id> | member:<member_id>
    department  dept:<id> for every department the caller belongs to
    org         every insider

A caller may NARROW its scope and never widen it. Writes are not here: remembering is a manifest
action through PHP (memory_remember, core_memory_set), where it is gated, logged and — when an
agent writes into shared memory — approved by a person first.
