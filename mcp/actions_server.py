"""certstudy_actions_mcp — the actions/navigation MCP server (localhost-only).

Unlike the read servers, this one acts AS a member: the assistant service passes a
short-lived signed action token (Authorization: Bearer <action_token>) minted by the PHP
/assistant handler. navigate() returns an HX-Location directive; action tools resolve
entities via the read views then POST to the app's own PHP endpoints with the action token
(same validation, authorization, and activity logging a human triggers). Never exposed
through Apache.
