# MaluDB OS Core

The **kernel** of a Business OS: a hosted platform that manages a company's **AI agent workforce**,
the **super-admins** who run it, and **single sign-on** for every business application — and runs
no business application itself.

Business applications (HR, projects, reservations, scheduling, …) are separate products with their
own repositories, database, MCP servers and expert agent. They plug into this kernel through a
published integration contract and are signed in by it.

> **Status:** active development. This repository started a clean public history on 2026-09-29.

## What the kernel does

| Area | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Estate** | One location tree — building → office (a VM) → desk (an enrolled desktop) — and the applications that reside there. |
| **Departments and people** | Org chart, department membership and administration, the directory of people, invitations. |
| **Agent HR** | Hiring, versioning and activating agents; prompts, skills, tool grants, duties, delegation; each agent has a human manager. |
| **Agent runtime** | Runs agents through per-model harnesses behind one interface; every model call is recorded in a prompt ledger. |
| **Applications** | Catalog and registry of applications, their roles and rights, scopes (sites or departments), and who holds what. |
| **Single sign-on** | `/launch/<id>` mints a 60-second, single-use hand-off token and signed claims and sends the browser to the application. |
| **Directory API** | Bearer-token API through which applications read (and, if allowed, change) people, departments and access. |
| **Approvals** | Sensitive agent and application actions pause for a super-admin's decision. |
| **AI Ops** | Runs, traces, evals, run verdicts, skill library, token spend and monthly **ledger statements** (dollar costs; no books). |
| **Assistants and messaging** | A personal assistant per person; agents message one another along the org tree; Telegram, SMS and email channels. |
| **Services for applications** | An application can text a member or call another application's shared tool through the kernel, without ever holding a provider key. |

## Architecture

Three names per company, one kernel:

```
 www.<domain>   public website (out of scope here)
 os.<domain>    THIS platform — super-admins and agents only
 app.<domain>   sign-in + launcher, for every human
 <app>.<domain> one name per application (own Apache / PostgreSQL / PHP / HTMX, own MCP, own expert agent)
```

```
 browser ──► Apache :80 ──► Next.js/React (web/, :3000)
                 │                 │  server components + actions only
                 │                 ▼
                 │          PHP JSON API (html/, 127.0.0.1:8080)  ──►  PostgreSQL 17 (certstudy)
                 │                 ▲
                 └─ /mcp/* ────────┼──►  MCP servers (Python, mcp/)
                                   │        records · activity · actions · memory
                                   │
                     agent runner (:8815/8816) ──► harnesses (Hermes, Claude Agent SDK, system_one)
                                   │
                                   └──► ledger proxy ──► model providers
                     MaluDB (activity memory, port 8000) ◄── activity ingest (every minute)
```

Key points:

- **React is the only UI.** `web/` reads through server components and writes through server actions, both via
  `web/lib/api.ts`. **The browser never talks to PHP.**
- **PHP is a localhost-only JSON API.** The public port exposes only an allow-list: `/api/v1/{health,me,members,org-graph}`,
  the `/mcp/*` proxies and a voice webhook. See `docs/deploy/apache-react-cutover.conf`.
- **Two faces on one codebase.** `OS_HOST` (super-admins and agents) and `APP_HOST` (sign-in, launcher, settings); leaving
  both empty gives a single face.
- **Memory-first.** Every state change is logged to `activity_log` and shipped to MaluDB; agents read records and activity
  through MCP servers.

## Repository layout

```

## Tech stack

- **PHP 8.3** — vanilla, feature-oriented page controllers with procedural PDO queries (no framework); Composer dependencies in `composer.json`.
- **PostgreSQL 17** — row-level security, security-barrier views, additive migrations.
- **Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript** on Node 24 — Bootstrap 5.3 “nxl” look for day-to-day screens.
- **Python 3.12 (FastMCP, asyncpg, uvicorn)** — MCP servers and the agent runner (`mcp/requirements.txt`).
- **MaluDB** — activity memory (`maludb_core` Postgres extension plus its API service).
- **Apache 2.4** reverse proxy, **systemd** services, **cron** for the few scheduled PHP jobs.

## Getting started

**The fresh-install runbook is [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md)** — Ubuntu 24.04, from an empty host to a signed-in
super-admin with the kernel's agents hired and the default applications installed, every step followed by its check,
written so a person or a Claude Code session with `sudo` can execute it. In outline:

1. **The host** — MaluDB core's bootstrap first (it brings PostgreSQL 17 from PGDG, pgvector, pgaudit and builds the
   `maludb_core` extension), then Apache + PHP 8.3 (`libapache2-mod-php8.3`, `php8.3-pgsql` …), Composer, Node 24.
2. **MaluDB** — the API service (:8000) and the kernel's own memory database `certstudy_memory` (schema and role
   `certstudy_mem`, `enable_memory_schema`, `grant_memory_access`), then a token from `POST /v1/tokens`.
3. **The code** — clone to `/var/www`, `composer install --no-dev`, `storage/` for `www-data`, `config/.env` (mode 640,
   group `www-data`) from `config/.env.example`, which documents **every** key the code reads.
4. **The database** — `createdb certstudy`, then `db/*.sql` in order as `postgres` (all 154 apply clean on an empty
   database); passwords for `app_rw`, `app_records_ro`, `app_activity_ro`, `app_runner`.
5. **Apache** — `docs/deploy/apache-react-cutover.conf` with your domain, `Listen 127.0.0.1:8080`, the PHP ini.
6. **The front end** — `npm ci && npm run build`, hand `.next` to `www-data`, the unit and its host drop-in.
7. **MCP servers and the activity ingest** — one venv from `mcp/requirements.txt`, five units and a timer.
8. **The agent runner** — `bos-runner`/`bos-agent`, the sandboxed launcher, `/etc/business-os/runner.env` (provider keys
   live only there), the pinned Claude Code CLI and its conformance suite.
9. **First super-admin** (`bin/bootstrap_organizer.php`), a model on the Claude harness, the business's settings, cron.
10. **The kernel's agents** — the Installer (`bin/hire_installation_agent.php`), the JEV prompt writer, the Auditor and
    Sysadmin in shadow, the embedding model for memory.
11. **The default applications** — `sudo bin/install_default_applications.sh --by <email> --domain <domain>`.

**Migrations are numbered and additive**: never edit an applied file, add the next number. Views keep
`WITH (security_barrier = true)`, and new columns are appended last.

### Installing on a MaluDB hosting virtual machine (with Claude Code)

A VM from MaluDB hosting already has Ubuntu 24.04, PostgreSQL 17 and MaluDB core, and an application in
`/var/www` whose configuration names the tenant's database connection and MaluDB memory schema. The kernel
**replaces the contents of `/var/www`**: the existing application is moved to a dated sibling directory, never
deleted, and its memory schema becomes the kernel's. Start a Claude Code session on the VM as the deploy user
(normally `maludb`, with `sudo`) and give it this prompt:

```
Use the installation instructions in https://github.com/maludb/maludb-os-core.git to install the MaluDB Business OS Core.
```

**The instructions are [`docs/install-on-maludb-hosting.md`](docs/install-on-maludb-hosting.md)** — the hosting
edition of the fresh-host runbook, which it calls section by section. The installer:

1. **Asks for the domain name of the installation** and the first super-admin's email and name, and which keys
   are available (Anthropic, OpenRouter, MaluMail, an embedder) — and reminds you that these names need **DNS A
   records** pointing at the VM before anyone can reach them:

   | Name | What answers there |
   |---|---|
   | `domain.com` (and `www.`) | the landing page |
   | `app.domain.com` | sign-in and the launcher |
   | `os.domain.com` | the operating system — super-admins and agents |
   | `hr.domain.com`, `helpdesk.domain.com`, `spaces.domain.com`, `projects.domain.com` | the four default applications |

   The install does not wait for DNS (the names resolve to loopback for its checks); the list is repeated at the end
   with the current A record beside each name.
2. **Surveys the host** (PostgreSQL 17, the `maludb_core` extension, the MaluDB API on :8000, Apache/PHP/Node) and
   installs only what is missing — never MaluDB's own bootstrap.
3. **Reads the existing application's configuration file** for the database host, port, name, user, password and
   MaluDB schema, confirms them with you (never printing the password), and checks the schema is memory-enabled.
4. **Moves `/var/www` to `/var/www-previous-<date>`** (and copies the Apache default site aside) after telling you,
   clones the kernel there and follows `docs/install.md` §3–§13 with the tenant's memory database in place of the
   runbook's `certstudy_memory`.
5. **Installs the four default applications** and closes with the DNS table, where the previous application went,
   the sign-in address, and what was left for you to set.

### Testing

- `php bin/test_app_services.php` — application services (SMS, application reads).
- `mcp/smoke_actions.py run mcp/smoke/<n>.json` — write-path smoke tests. **They write real rows** named `SMOKE <run>`; run them
  only against a development database.
- `mcp/agent_runner/tests/` — runner unit tests.

## Services and scheduled jobs

| systemd unit | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `certstudy-web` | 3000 | Next.js front end |
| `certstudy-records-mcp` | 8811 | record-memory MCP (PostgreSQL) |
| `certstudy-activity-mcp` | 8812 | activity-memory MCP (MaluDB) |
| `certstudy-actions-mcp` | 8813 | action MCP: state-changing tools, approval hook in front |
| `certstudy-memory-mcp` | 8814 | agent memory MCP |
| `certstudy-agent-runner` | 8815/8816 | agent runner and ledger proxy |
| `certstudy-channels` | — | Telegram / SMS / email channel worker |
| `certstudy-activity-ingest.timer` | — | ships `activity_log` to MaluDB every minute |

Cron (`docs/deploy/crontab.example`): invitation-expiry report, outbound-email flush, approval expiry. Agents' scheduled duties
are fired by the runner's scheduler, not by cron.

## Configuration and secrets

- `config/.env` (PHP and tooling) and `web/.env.local` are **gitignored** — never commit them. Copy from the `*.example` files.
- Provider keys (Anthropic, OpenRouter, …) live in the runner's own environment file (`docs/deploy/runner.env.example`), never in `config/.env`.
- Tenant secrets stored by the platform are encrypted with `SECRETS_KEY`. **Never replace it; rotation adds a version.**
- API keys only: no consumer-account logins are used for model access.
- Session transcripts (`claude-log/`) and `.env` backups are gitignored because they may contain pasted secrets.

## Roles and access

Exactly three business roles: `super_admin`, `dept_admin`, `user`. “External” is a flag on a user, not a role, and agents are always
`user`. A dept-admin administers only the departments they are flagged admin of or manage; elsewhere they are an ordinary user.
Only super-admins may use the `os.` face, decide approvals, and grant application access. Application users are not OS users.

## Agents

- **Harness per model** behind one runner interface. Built: `hermes`, `claude_agent_sdk`, and `system_one` (JEV-driven playbooks).
- **Five standing departments** in every tenant: Front Office (root of the org chart), HR, Accounting, Audit, IT.
- **Every application has an expert agent and every department a lead**, proposed by the platform and confirmed by a person.
- **Prompt ledger:** every model call is recorded with full context, response, tokens, latency and cost, and linked to the activity log.
- **Evals** run on demand or on schedule by an Auditor agent, are graded by JEV, and *advise* — they never block an agent. An eval run may not change anything.
- **Approvals** pause sensitive actions until a super-admin decides.
- **Skills** are versioned in a library (AI Ops → Skills) and read by agents through the records MCP.

## Integrating an application

An application from us:

1. lives in its own repository (installed by convention at `/srv/apps/<catalog_key>`), with its own PostgreSQL database, PHP/HTMX UI and MCP servers;
2. declares itself in a `maludb-os.json` manifest — roles and rights, scopes, shared and consumed tools, its expert agent;
3. accepts the kernel's **hand-off token** at its `sso_path` and verifies the signed claims;
4. reads people and access through the **directory API**, and receives a change feed;
5. runs its agents through the kernel's **chat endpoint** and never holds a model key;
6. exports token accounting through the kernel's **ledger period export**.

The installer is `bin/app_install.php plan|apply <repository>` (`plan` is read-only; `apply` is run by a person with root) and
`bin/install_default_applications.sh`, which installs the four default applications (HR, Projects, Help Desk, Spaces) straight from GitHub. The contract is documented
in `docs/business-os-integration.md` and the `kernel-*.md` specs in `docs/build-specs/`.

### Repositories

Everything that is part of the OS lives under [github.com/maludb](https://github.com/maludb). The kernel is `maludb-os-core`;
every application is `maludb-os-<catalog_key>`, where `catalog_key` is the key its `maludb-os.json` declares and the directory it
installs to under `/srv/apps/`.

## Development conventions

- **Read the docs first, in order:** `docs/business-os-integration.md`, `docs/business-os-requirements.md`, `docs/business-os-build-plan.md`. `CLAUDE.md` holds the standing project rules for AI-assisted work.
- **Every slice ships whole:** screens (no modals, full-page create/edit, works at 375px), handlers, activity logging, action-manifest entries and MCP tools.
- **Every state-changing handler:** `require_post()`, `verify_csrf()`, an authorization check, and `log_activity()`.
- **Reads** go through whitelist presenters in `app/features/<feature>/present.php`; never serialize raw rows.
- **Writes** report through `emit_action_status()` and `json_mode_finish()`.
- **No new PHP templates.** `app/views/` holds only mail bodies.
- **Public (no-login) pages** go on the public list in `web/middleware.ts`, never on Apache's allow-list.
- **Commit style:** one commit per finished step, on `main`.
