-- 107: the agent runner may read department handbooks — and nothing else in Documents.
--
-- Requirements, "The HR lifecycle": onboard = job description plus the department handbook in the
-- agent's context. The runner renders that context (docs/build-specs/agent-runtime-hermes.md,
-- "Profile rendering"), and until now app_runner had no way to read a handbook, so the persona went
-- without one.
--
-- app_runner gets no grant on `documents`: a view hands it exactly one thing, the live handbook of a
-- department — title and Markdown body, no files, no other kinds, nothing archived or deleted.
--
-- Which document is a department's handbook:
--   1. the one the department names (departments.handbook_document_id), when it is still live and
--      is something written here (a page of any kind — never an uploaded file);
--   2. otherwise the department's most recently updated live document of kind 'handbook'.
-- (2) exists because nothing sets the pointer yet: a handbook written in Documents for a department
-- should reach that department's agents without a second step.
--
-- Additive only. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/107_runner_department_handbooks.sql
