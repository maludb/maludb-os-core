-- 075_uniform_mcp_registry.sql
-- One registry for every MCP server an agent can use — including our own.
--
-- Decided 2026-09-18. The estate already models technical assets properly: `applications` has
-- `database` and `storage` categories, an owning department, a location, criticality, health and
-- what it costs; `application_endpoints` carries `kind = 'mcp'`, an `auth_kind`, a `secret_id`
-- holding only a REFERENCE, an `agent_reachable` flag and `mcp_surface_version`; and
-- `application_access` grants to a member or a department with read/write/admin, expiry and
-- revocation. Nothing about that needed inventing.
--
-- What blocked it: `agent_tool_grants.server` was a hard-coded CHECK over
-- ('records','activity','actions','desk'). However well a new asset was registered — a data
-- lake, a warehouse, a vector store — no agent could be granted a tool on it, because the grant
-- had nowhere to point. The inventory and the thing agents actually use were two systems.
--
-- So the grant now references an endpoint, and OUR OWN servers are registered like everyone
-- else's. The alternative (keep the four, add an optional endpoint reference) would have left
-- two ways to name a server, which is the "two sources of truth" mistake this project has
-- already paid for three times.
--
-- Safe to do now: agent_tool_grants holds zero rows, so there is nothing to convert.
