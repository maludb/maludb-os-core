-- 122: what happened INSIDE an agent run is kept — tool calls, their outcome and how long they took.
--
-- The prompt ledger keeps every model call whole (context, response, tokens, latency, cost), and a
-- tool's arguments and result are in the next call's context. What was NOT kept anywhere: which tool
-- ran, whether it failed, and how long it took. The harness's observer plugin reported those to the
-- runner, which held them in memory (the last 500 per run) and lost them at every restart. Evaluating
-- an agent later — tool selection, error recovery, where the time went — needs them, and they cannot
-- be backfilled (owner, 2026-09-20: every agent must be creating the data evaluations will need).
--
-- One row per observed event, in the order the runner received it. No arguments and no results here:
-- those are already in prompt_payloads, and this table stays small enough to keep for good.
--
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/122_agent_run_events.sql
