-- 157: proposed department leads, and the screens' places in the menu (owner-approved 2026-09-27;
-- docs/build-specs/assistants-and-messaging.md §7 and §9, build step 7).
--
-- A department with agents in it (or a standing department) and no lead orchestrator gets a PROPOSED
-- lead: an orchestrator named for it, its job drawn from the department handbook, its roster the
-- department's specialists, placed under the personal assistant whose person runs the department. The
-- proposal is a row, not an agent: a super-admin confirms it in one click (the hire happens then, logged
-- as any hire) or declines it. Nothing is hired unconfirmed. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/157_lead_proposals.sql
