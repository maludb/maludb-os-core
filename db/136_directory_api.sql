-- 136: the directory API (A4, 2026-09-22).
--
-- docs/business-os-integration.md, "The directory API": the kernel owns who exists, their role and
-- status, their departments; an application from us mirrors that and — HR alone — changes it
-- through the kernel, never through shared tables. Three additions:
--   * an APPLICATION TOKEN: mcp_access_tokens gains scope 'application' and the application it
--     belongs to (one live token per application; retiring the application revokes it). Its
--     member_id is the super-admin who minted it: the directory is read as the kernel sees it.
--   * applications.directory_writes — maludb-os.json "directory.writes": the kernel refuses a
--     write from an application that did not declare them.
--   * activity_log.source 'application' — a directory write is a person's act (X-Acting-Member),
--     made from inside an application.
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/136_directory_api.sql
