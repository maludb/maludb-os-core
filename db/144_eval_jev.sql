-- 144: evals graded by JEV (2026-09-26 — docs/build-specs/eval-jev-grader.md).
--
-- A case may be graded by JEV (TypeSafe's System One model, through OpenRouter): its `checks` are typed
-- questions — noul / choice / score — each with a pass rule; the runner asks them all in one call per
-- trial, through the ledger proxy. An answer JEV is unsure of routes the case to a person
-- (`awaiting_person`), excluded from the score until graded. Every check's answer is kept in
-- `grader_detail`, also when a person grades, so agreement can be measured (mcp_eval_check_calibration).
-- Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/144_eval_jev.sql
