-- 150: the JEV prompt writer reads the judgement evidence (owner, 2026-09-27;
-- docs/build-specs/jev-prompt-writer.md).
--
-- The system_one decision trail, system events and probes, and the eval sets, cases, runs, results,
-- schedules, alerts, calibration and trace grades were visible to people only. The JEV prompt writer
-- (an active agent whose role is jev_prompt_writer — agent 53) drafts the questions those judgements
-- are made with, and cannot diagnose a wrong answer it cannot see: the owner opened them to it, read
-- only. Each view keeps its rule for everyone else and gains "OR app_reads_judgement_evidence()". The
-- prompt ledger (every model call's full context) stays closed. Additive; the views' columns are
-- unchanged, so their grants stand.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/150_jev_writer_evidence.sql
