-- 163: Agent Chat — a person talks to one agent from its page (2026-09-29).
--
-- docs/build-specs/agent-chat.md. A turn is an ordinary agent run with trigger 'chat' (the person's
-- words are agent_runs.chat_utterance and the agent's are result, both from db/138); what is new is
-- the conversation that groups the turns and belongs to ONE person. Owner decision: conversations
-- are private to their person; the runs stay visible wherever runs are visible today. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/163_agent_chat.sql
