-- 161: kernel services for applications — SMS (K6) and application reads (K7) (owner, 2026-09-28;
-- docs/build-specs/kernel-app-services.md). Additive.
--
-- K6: an application texts a member through the kernel. The business's notification number is a
-- notification_endpoints row (its Twilio auth token a tenant secret, by reference); a text waits in
-- application_notifications until the channels worker sends it; a member may turn one application's texts off.
-- K7: a provider application shares named read tools (application_shares, from its maludb-os.json); a consumer asks
-- the kernel to call one over a connection a super-admin approved (application_connections).
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/161_app_services.sql
