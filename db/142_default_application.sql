-- 142: a person's default application (2026-09-26 — the owner's direction; docs/build-specs/kernel-default-application.md).
--
-- Arriving at app.<domain>/ or just after signing in, a person who is not a super-admin is taken
-- straight into their default application (and scope, on a scoped one) when they still hold it; with
-- no usable default and exactly one application, into that one; with several, the launcher; with
-- none, the launcher saying so. Set by the person in their settings or by whoever may administer
-- them (app_can_admin_member). Only an application — and scope — the person holds may be named;
-- the default is advice to the landing page, never a grant. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/142_default_application.sql
