-- 174: K29 — the ProcessCore application in the catalog (D15 of /srv/apps/processcore/docs/processcore-design.md, owner approved
-- 2026-10-08): a base manufacturing application for converting processes — material in as lots, runs on equipment turning them
-- into other lots (products, co-products, scrap), packaging, quality release, shipments; industry is data, not code (a profile
-- seeds the item classes, operations and vocabulary; steel processing the default). Forked from the cidery. The catalog's category
-- check gains 'manufacturing' (there was none — the cidery sits under 'other'); the PHP list APPLICATION_CATEGORIES is widened in
-- the same change. Seeded so every installation shows it under Operations ("from us, not installed") and the installer's apply
-- finds its row. On request, not a default. Additive.
