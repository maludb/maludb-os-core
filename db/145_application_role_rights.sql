-- 145: application roles published by the application, several per grant (2026-09-27 —
-- docs/build-specs/kernel-application-roles.md).
--
-- An application from us publishes its roles through its own MCP server (tool `app_roles`): each
-- role's name, description, the rights it gives inside the application and the kernel capability it
-- amounts to. The kernel keeps a copy, refreshed on demand, and a super-admin grants a person a SET
-- of roles. A role the application stops publishing is withdrawn, never deleted, so the grants that
-- still hold it can be shown and fixed. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/145_application_role_rights.sql
