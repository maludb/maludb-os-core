-- 124: a person's verdict on a run — the cheapest label an evaluation can ever have.
--
-- docs/build-specs/eval-evidence.md, "Open — for the owner", item 1: of everything an evaluation
-- will want, a human judgement of whether a run was any good is the one thing the platform records
-- nowhere. Every other piece of evidence is already kept (prompt_ledger, prompt_payloads,
-- agent_runs, agent_run_events, activity_log). Approved by the owner 2026-09-20.
--
-- It cannot be backfilled. Nobody will remember in March whether Tuesday's morning brief was good,
-- so every day without this table is a day of unlabelled runs — which is exactly the argument that
-- made activity logging mandatory from day one.
--
-- A verdict is deliberately coarse: good or bad, plus an optional note. Anything richer is a rubric,
-- and a rubric belongs to an eval case. One verdict per person per thing, changeable — a second
-- thought replaces the first rather than stacking up.
--
-- It attaches to EITHER an agent run OR one assistant answer (a prompt_ledger row): the command bar
-- is the most-used AI in the product and its answers deserve the same label.
--
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/124_run_verdicts.sql
