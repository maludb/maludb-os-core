-- 137: the ledger's period statement (A5, 2026-09-22).
--
-- docs/business-os-integration.md, "Token accounting": the kernel keeps token accounting only, with
-- dollar costs, and exports it. Each calendar month the ledger rolls up into one statement per
-- provider, model, department, agent, application and currency; a super-admin closes a period, a
-- closed statement never changes, and a call that arrives late for a closed period lands in the
-- open period with a note. The roll-up table that used to feed the books keeps this job; its
-- books vocabulary goes.
--
--   * ai_periods — one row per month: open or closed, and the ledger high-water mark at close
--     (a call above it for a closed month is "late").
--   * ai_usage_postings — status open/closed/void (was draft/posted/void), posted_* renamed
--     closed_*, plus application_id, currency in the key, and late_calls.
--   * prompt_ledger.application_id and agent_runs.application_id — the application a chat run
--     was made for (A6 writes it); NULL for the kernel's own runs.
-- The view mcp_ai_usage_postings is recreated (a renamed column cannot be replaced in place);
-- mcp_prompt_ledger and mcp_agent_runs gain application_id appended last.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/137_ai_periods.sql
