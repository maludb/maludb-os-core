-- 154: personal assistants and the orchestrator tree (owner-approved 2026-09-27;
-- docs/build-specs/assistants-and-messaging.md, build steps 1 and 2).
--
-- db/072 made delegation ONE level deep: the two ends of a roster row had to be opposite kinds, which
-- was also its cycle prevention. The owner reversed it: a person's assistant orchestrates department
-- leads, and in a large organisation assistants sit over assistants. So an orchestrator may now hold
-- ORCHESTRATORS as well as subagents, under three rules that keep the old guarantees:
--   * an orchestrator has at most ONE live parent (a subagent — a leaf — may still serve several
--     orchestrators, as db/072 intended; leaves cannot make a cycle);
--   * no cycles — the parent may not be among the child's descendants;
--   * depth at most 5 levels, counting the specialist at the bottom.
-- A PERSONAL ASSISTANT is an orchestrator with a principal: the one person it serves and the only
-- person it talks to. Its reach is its person's (app_agent_reach_department_ids()). Every delegation
-- records where it went and why (agent_runs.delegated_department_id, delegation_reason). Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/154_assistant_tree.sql
