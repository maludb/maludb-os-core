-- 165: Claude subscription login is for the Claude Code harness ONLY (2026-09-29).
--
-- db/164 allowed the hermes harness too. Hermes, given a subscription token, presents itself as Claude Code (a claude-code
-- user-agent, x-app: cli, and "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI" prepended to the system prompt) — impersonating
-- Anthropic's client to use a subscription. The official CLI does not: it IS the client. So the feature is limited to
-- claude_agent_sdk, and the two Hermes "Max plan" twin rows db/164 seeded are removed (nothing referenced them).
-- Additive in effect: no agent ever used them. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/165_subscription_claude_code_only.sql
