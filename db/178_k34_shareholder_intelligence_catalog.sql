-- 178: K34 — the Shareholder Intelligence application in the catalog (D1/D15 of
-- /srv/apps/shareholder_intelligence/docs/shareholder-intelligence-design.md §12–13, the owner approved 2026-10-09): shareholder
-- surveillance for a publicly traded company (or an advisory firm serving several) — the DTC Security Position Report, the NOBO list
-- and the transfer agent's register uploaded and reconciled with the share count, holders matched across lists, SEC EDGAR, FINRA
-- short interest and daily short volume, the SEC's fails-to-deliver and the Reg SHO threshold lists fetched under a declared policy,
-- prices and events, nineteen signal rules with an evidence class on every signal for a person to judge. BOTH category checks gain
-- 'investor_relations' in this one file (the K30 lesson of db/175: K27 and K29 widened the catalog's check only and the ProcessCore
-- apply failed at register); the PHP list APPLICATION_CATEGORIES is widened in the same change. Seeded so every installation shows
-- it under Finance ("from us, not installed") and the installer's apply finds its row. On request, not a default. Additive.
