-- 141: scoped applications (phase 7 Part C, C1, 2026-09-25 — docs/build-specs/kernel-scoped-applications.md).
--
-- One installation of an application may serve several sites (a restaurant each) or several
-- departments (each its own project plans). The application declares which (scope_kind) and its own
-- roles, each carrying the kernel capability it amounts to. A grant names a scope and a role and goes
-- to a member, a department, or the residents of a site. A site is a new location kind: a place the
-- business trades from, not a machine. Application users are not OS users: nothing is granted by
-- default. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
