-- 135: where an application receives the platform's sign-on (A3, 2026-09-22).
--
-- docs/business-os-integration.md, "Identity and single sign-on": the kernel is the one identity;
-- an application from us keeps no password. The launcher mints a 60-second, single-use hand-off
-- token for a person with a live access grant and sends the browser to the application's sso path;
-- the kernel's sign-out posts a notice to the logout path. Both paths are the application's
-- declaration (maludb-os.json, "sso"), recorded here at registration. An application with no sso
-- path cannot be signed in to: the launcher opens its address as it is.
--
-- Additive: two columns, appended last to the two views they travel on. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/135_application_sign_on.sql
