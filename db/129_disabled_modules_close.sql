-- 129: a DISABLED application is closed — to people, to agents and to MCP
-- (docs/build-specs/data-driven-nav.md, step 3; the owner's three statuses, 2026-09-20).
--
--   active    in the sidebar and usable
--   hidden    not in the sidebar, still usable by URL, by agents and by MCP
--   disabled  not in the sidebar and NOT usable by anyone — the super-admin included
--
-- A module is closed when every sidebar entry that carries its grant is disabled (Contacts and
-- Deals share `contacts`: disabling Deals alone hides Deals; the module closes when both are).
-- The test goes into the two functions everything already passes through, so nothing else needs
-- to learn about it:
--   app_has_module()  screen entry (PHP require_module / require_module_grant), app_nav(),
--                     app_my_work(), the app_can_see_* family and the views that call it
--   app_path_closed()       the front door of every PHP request (app/bootstrap.php)
--   app_disabled_modules()  the MCP servers' own gate on every tool call (mcp/module_status.py)
--   app_can_see()     the row rule behind the mcp_* views — what the records MCP server reads.
--                     It had three branches that never asked app_has_module (your own record,
--                     super-admin, dept-admin in their department); a closed module now refuses
--                     before any of them.
-- Data is never touched: back to active or hidden and everything is there again.
-- While nothing is disabled both functions answer exactly as before.
--
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/129_disabled_modules_close.sql

-- the request is refused, whoever asks — a person, or the actions MCP server posting for an agent.
