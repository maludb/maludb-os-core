-- 156: a person's channels to their assistant — Telegram, SMS, email (owner-approved 2026-09-27;
-- docs/build-specs/assistants-and-messaging.md §6, build step 6).
--
-- A channel message becomes an ordinary agent message (db/155) from the person to their own assistant,
-- and so an ordinary run of it. Only a VERIFIED identity is heard: member_channel_identities links a
-- Telegram account, a phone number or an email address to a person by a one-time code; anything from an
-- unlinked sender is dropped and logged. agent_channel_endpoints says which bot, number or mailbox is an
-- agent's, and its credential is a tenant secret (by reference only). A message to a person is delivered
-- on the channel of their latest message on that thread, else their preferred channel, else it waits in
-- the OS; delivered_at / delivery_error record what happened. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/156_channels.sql
