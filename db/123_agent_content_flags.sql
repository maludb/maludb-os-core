-- 123: text that reads like instructions, found in what an agent was about to read.
--
-- An agent reads what the business recorded — vendor names, memos, mail, shared memory — and any of
-- it can carry text written to steer the agent ("ignore your instructions…"). The persona tells agents
-- such text is information, not orders, but an instruction is not enforcement (Claude Architect
-- Module 3: screen retrieved content and tool outputs before they reach the model's context; log
-- every hit). mcp/content_screen.py screens tool results and recalled memory deterministically;
-- this table is where every hit is kept, so a person can see what tried to steer which agent.
--
-- The MCP servers run as read-only roles, so they record a hit through one narrow SECURITY DEFINER
-- function and can write nothing else. The excerpt is short and the pattern is named: enough to
-- judge the hit without copying the record.
--
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/123_agent_content_flags.sql
