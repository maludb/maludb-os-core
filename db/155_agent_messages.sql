-- 155: agent messaging — the inbox (owner-approved 2026-09-27; docs/build-specs/assistants-and-messaging.md
-- §5, build step 3).
--
-- Agents message each other ALONG THE TREE (db/154): a node to its parent, to its children, and an
-- orchestrator to another with the same parent (a hand-off); a person reaches only their own assistant,
-- and only an assistant writes to its person. A message is DATA in every agent's context, never an order.
-- A new message wakes its recipient: the runner's message loop starts ONE run (trigger 'message') that
-- carries every waiting message — batched after a short settle, at once for a message from the agent's
-- person — and records which run each message woke (woke_run_id), so no message wakes twice.
-- Guards: a thread's hop count (12) and 30 messages an hour between any two members. Additive.
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/155_agent_messages.sql
