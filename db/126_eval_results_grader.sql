-- 126: an eval result says how it was graded, and whether a person has yet.
--
-- A run's score counts only what has been GRADED (owner, 2026-09-20): a human-graded case waits
-- for a person and is in neither the passed nor the failed column until they say. mcp_eval_results
-- could not show that — it carried `passed`, which for an ungraded human case is merely the
-- placeholder the runner wrote, and a reader would take it for a failure.
--
-- Two columns appended (never inserted mid-list) and the security barrier kept, per the migration
-- rules in CLAUDE.md:
--   grader     — how this case is graded, from eval_cases
--   graded_by  — the person who graded it, NULL when nobody has
--
-- Additive; the view is replaced with the same rows and the same rule (people only).
-- Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/126_eval_results_grader.sql
