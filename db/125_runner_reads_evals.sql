-- 125: the agent runner may work an evaluation.
--
-- db/046 defined evaluations and db/097 gave the runner exactly what rendering a profile and
-- scheduling a duty need — which was right at the time, because nothing ran an evaluation. The
-- eval runner (docs/build-specs/eval-runner.md) does, so it needs the set it is running, the cases
-- in it, and somewhere to write each case's result and the run's score.
--
-- The grants are the boundary, as db/097 says: a policy cannot give a role a privilege it was
-- never granted, so the column list on eval_runs is deliberately short. The runner may say how a
-- run went; it may NOT change what the run was asked to test — not its set, not its agent, not its
-- config version, not its threshold, and not who started it. An evaluation that could rewrite its
-- own question is not evidence.
--
-- eval_sets and eval_cases stay read-only to it: cases are people's work (the endpoints refuse
-- agent callers, and the runner is not a person either).
--
-- Additive. Run as postgres:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d certstudy -f db/125_runner_reads_evals.sql
